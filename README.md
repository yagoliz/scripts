# Scripts

This repository contains some scripts for different tasks, that I've found useful over time.

Each script is described below:

- **bumblebee-fix**: These are instructions to get bumblebee running on a Dell XPS 15 on Manjaro.
- **enable-gpu**: With this script you can control when to turn the Nvidia GPU on if you want to use it with Bumblebee.
- **disable-gpu**: This one turns off the GPU. Don't worry if you forget to turn the card off, the if you follow [bumblebee-fix](bumblebee-fix.md) it will explain how to create a service that shuts down the card when you turn your machine off.
- **get-power**: Simple script to get the power being consumed by your machine.
- **pdf-merge**: This tool creates a pdf combining all other pdfs on a given folder. It requires to have [latex](https://www.latex-project.org/) installed.
- **cmake-build**: This simple tool automatizes the process of building a Cmake project.
